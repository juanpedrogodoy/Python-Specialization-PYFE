# Python for Everybody Specialization (PY4E) 🐍
This repository is a comprehensive collection of my work throughout the **Python for Everybody** specialization by Dr. Charles Severance (University of Michigan). It documents my growth from a beginner to a developer capable of building relational databases and processing web data.

## Learning Evolution

## Repository Structure & Practice Challenges

### Module 1: Programming for Everybody
*Coursework + Custom logic challenges.*
- **Core Assignments:** Pay calculators, temperature converters.
- **Extra Practice:** - `custom_logic_challenges.py`: A collection of scripts created to master nested conditionals and complex loop patterns.

### Module 2: Python Data Structures
*Advanced manipulation of collections.*
- **Core Assignments:** File parsing and word counting.
- **Extra Practice:** - `data_cleaning_tool.py`: Exercises focused on cleaning "dirty" text data using lists and dictionaries.

### Module 3: Using Python to Access Web Data
*Data extraction and web communication.*
- **Core Assignments:** - Scraping names and numbers from HTML using **BeautifulSoup**.
    - Extracting data from **XML** and **JSON** APIs.
- **Extra Practice & Challenges:**
    - `regex_data_miner.py`: Advanced pattern matching to extract specific information from unstructured text files.
    - `api_response_cleaner.py`: Custom script to process and format "raw" JSON data into a readable structure.
    - `web_link_crawler.py`: A project designed to practice recursive navigation through multiple web pages.

### Module 4: Using Databases with Python
*Relational modeling and SQL performance.*
- **Core Assignments:** Musical Track DB, Student Roster Manager.
- **Extra Practice (Custom Scenarios):**
    - **Movie-Director Schema:** Implementation of one-to-many relationships from scratch.
    - **Expense Tracker Stats:** Practice with SQL aggregate functions (`SUM`, `GROUP BY`) for financial data.
    - **School Management System:** A complex three-table join exercise to simulate real-world academic environments.
